This code requires OpenCV 3.3 and TileDB 0.6.1, as well as gtest for the unit test code. 

Compile the code by running scons in the main folder. 

To run the unit tests, create a folder in test called image_results. Then run ./unit_test to make sure things are working as they should be. Right now, three tests may fail (TDBImageTest.CopyConstructor, TDBImageTest.DeleteImage, ImageDataTest.DeleteTDB), this is a known issue with the 0.6.1 version of TileDB. 

More information can be found by running doxygen to get the full API of the code, or by looking at the wiki on github.com/IntelLabs/vcl
